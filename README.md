# üõ†Ô∏è GenAI Hackathon ‚Äì Repo Setup (Phase 0)

This repository has been initialized for our hackathon project.  
Below is the breakdown of the current structure and the role of each file/folder.

---

## üìÇ Current Repo Structure

### `.vscode/`
- Contains project-specific **VS Code settings**.
- Ensures:
  - Correct Python interpreter (`.venv/bin/python` via `uv`).
  - Auto-activation of virtual environment in the terminal.
  - Cleaner imports from a future `src/` folder.
  - Auto-format on save + organize imports.

üîë Purpose: Keeps all teammates consistent in their dev setup.

---

### `.gitattributes`
- Configures how Git handles files.
- Prevents issues like line-ending mismatches across OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).

---

### `.gitignore`
- Lists files and folders Git should **ignore**.
- Commonly excludes:
  - Virtual environments (`.venv/`)
  - Cache files (`__pycache__/`)
  - Other local/temporary files

---

### `.python-version`
- Defines the **Python version** for the project.
- Ensures everyone uses the same version (important for `uv`/`pyenv`).

---

### `README.md`
- This file (documentation for the project).
- Will include:
  - Project description + problem statement
  - Setup instructions (`git clone`, `uv venv`, `uv sync`)
  - Contribution guidelines

---

### `main.py`
- Entry script for the project.
- Currently a placeholder.
- Will later evolve into the **driver code** for our prototype.

---

### `pyproject.toml`
- Core **project configuration** file.
- Managed by **uv**.
- Defines:
  - Dependencies (runtime + dev)
  - Metadata
  - Tooling configs (formatters, linters, etc.)

---

### `uv.lock`
- Dependency lockfile (generated by `uv`).
- Records exact versions of installed packages.
- Ensures reproducible environments when teammates run `uv sync`.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 0 Summary
- Repo initialized with base config files.  
- VS Code and Python environment standardized across the team.  
- Ready for **Phase 1: Feature development + structured codebase**.
